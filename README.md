# Glowing Earings    

## Project Overview

I came up with the proejct after thinking about cool jewlwery I c ould make for my girlfreind. I had thought that earring were always a formfactor which I could do something cool with. I had wanted to make the earring as simple as possible to use, dissasemble, service, and find replacment parts for. I think I was sucessful in all these aspects as well as creating cool and intreguing statment peices. 

## First Design 

My first design was very crude and failed in almost every aspect, but it was a great stepiing off point and allowed me to see that the project had potential. 

### Material Choice and Design 

I used acrylic for the fist design since I did not want to have to deal with my 3D-Printer. I used a bandsaw and disk sandder to create the basic shapes. I wanted to stick to straight lines since it was easy to fabricate and evoked a glowing mineral vibe. I used a router to carve out space for the battery. All of these fabrication techniques lacked precision and produced a very crude looking chassis. As well the design was clear, not translucent. This meant tha tthe battery was psrt of the earring in a way that made the design look over complicated instead of intrequing. The channels that the led probes slid into were cut using a dremel. This looked ugly when fully assembled and only added to the messing look. The dremmeled out channels were also very finicky and unable to provide enough clamping force to create a solid connection between the battery faces and the probes. 

everything except the overall design language of the intial design would be replaced with much more robust choices in the following iterations. 

### Electrical Components 

The electrical components of the earring needed to be as brain-dead simple as possible for me to feel comfortable giving the earrings as a gift. The meant that the less parts in the circut the better. LEDs generally need 3 volts to shine brightly, so I found that a 3.3 volt coin battery would be an adequate choice. Although this does slightly overvolt the LED, I felt that the tradeoff in lifetime was worth the simplification in design. I ended up using a CR2016 battery since they have a decent life and and are a good size and thickness for the project. 

To allow the LEDs to be replacable (for both servicability as a well as color choice) I decided to use the LED probes as their own retention mechanism. I designed the cahssis to accept slightly bent in probes. These appleid enough tension to keep consistent contact with the sides of the LED faces.

### Securing Devices 

My acrylic designs used two diffrent systems for securing the two halves of the earrings together. The first was two random computer screws self-tapped into the acrylic. These were very bulky, easilly chipped the acrylic, and were not long enough to solidly hold together the halves. After running out of screws (a lack of matching screws and losing multiple) I decided to use another system. 

My next design used small rare-earth magnets. These were much cleaner, but added even more weight to the design and increased the size of the chassis. They also had very poor binding force and caused the LED probes to not make solid contact with the battery faces. After this complete failure I decided that screws would be the way forward. 


## 3D Printed Design 
  
After my acrylic designs showed potential but significant issues in almost every aspect I decided to use my 3D printer. This meant that I had to print 20+ variations to finure out the correct tolerances, printing settings, and infil patterns. 

### Design Changes

The 3D printer allowed me to do much more complex designs that had much better tollerances while using less material. I ended up trying to target
