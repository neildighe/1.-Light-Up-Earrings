I came up with the project after thinking about cool jewelry I could make for my girlfriend.I had wanted to make the earring as simple as possible to use, disassemble, service, and find replacement parts for. I think I was successful in all these aspects as well as in creating cool and intriguing statement pieces.

### Material Choice and Design 

I used acrylic for the first design since I did not want to have to deal with my 3D printer. This material made the main housing clear, which fully showed the battery and was a poor diffuser of light. The acrylic was also unable to provide enough clamping force to create a solid connection between the battery faces and the probes. 


The electrical components needed to be as simple as possible. Using just a 3.3 volt coin battery and a 3 volt LED ended up being a perfect solution for simplicity, cost, and weight savings.  

LED PROBE DRAWWING

To allow the LEDs to be easily swapped I decided to use the LED probes as their own retention mechanism. I designed the chassis to accept slightly binward bent probes. These applied enough tension to keep consistent contact with both sides of the coin battery


I went with an assortment of solid colored 5mm LEDs as well as a pack of RGB cycling LEDS. The only problem I had using this form factor of LED was that the "purple" LEDs were actually UV. These required more than 3.3 volts to power, leading to an underwealming viewing experince. 
 

My acrylic designs used two different systems for securing the two earring halves together. The first was two random computer screws self-tapped into the acrylic. These were  bulky, easily chipped the acrylic, and were not long enough to provide a reliable connection. I quickly decided a different system was going to be needed. 

My next design used small magnets. These were much easier to use but added  more weight  and increased the overall size of the battery housings. They also were even worse at holding the sides together and were quickly abandoned.

## 3D Printing 
  
After my acrylic designs showed potential but significant issues in almost every aspect, I decided to use my 3D printer. This meant that I had to print 20+ variations to figure out the correct tolerances, printing settings, and infill patterns. the 3D printer and its glass bed also allowed me to not need to worry about surface finish and have a smooth polished feel straight off the printer. 

### Design Changes

The 3D printer allowed me to do much more complex designs that had much better tolerances while using less material. I ended up trying to target 6 grams per earring. The 3D printed designs were all made in Solidworks and featured very thin features. These had to be kept to a minimum thickness of 0.4mm due to the 3D printer's nozzle. I was able to drastically slim down the design of the earrings, which was needed. 

The 3D designs allowed for M2 nuts and bolts to be inset into the chassis. I made many variations with pockets for the nuts but ended up using self-tapped holes instead. The nuts added unneeded weight as well and required much higher tolerances than the rest of the design. The self-tapped holes were very strong, and I donâ€™t think that they will wear out.

The 3D printer allowed me also to create much more precise holes for the LED probes. This allowed for a much more secure fit of the LED and the ability to create LED diffusers that wrapped around the chassis. 

The final 3D printed designs were held together by the earring ring and hook. This combined with tight tolerances means that the earring can be completely opened for service without any parts falling off the assembly. This makes the design much more user friendly. 

The 3D printer also allowed me to use infill to help hide the battery and capture some light from the LED diffusers. I used 30% gyroid infill for both sides of the chassis.

## LED Diffuser Designs

**^(This image shows all of the different diffuser designs which were used to experiment with many different print settings. In the bottom right you can see the test jig use to find the correct tolerances for the LED hole in the diffusers.)**

I started out with a simple triangle made of acrylic with a hole drilled into it for the LED. This triangle was then sanded on all faces to allow it to diffuse the LED.

After switching to 3D printed designs, I created 3 designs: a "foxhead", teardrop, and circular design. I did not do any surface finishing to the parts since I was worried that I would over sand and ruin the tolerances and create lopsided faces. The diffusers look somewhat unfinished when not lit up. When lit-up however they all have their own characteristics and look great.

The diffusers all friction fit onto the LEDs and have a satisfying snap or "push" depending on what type of LED is used. Finding the correct dimensions for the hole took quite a few iterations. 

I ended up either using 80% or 100% gyroid infill for the diffusers. 

## Conclusion
Overall, I felt like the project was an overwhelming success. Although starting I felt that the project may hit a dead end, the transition to 3D printing really allowed me to perfect my design and create a well thought out piece of jewelry. I do wish I was more consfident with 3D printed finishing techniques, because I hate the change in surface texture that happens half way up on the LED Diffuers, but otherwise everything turned out great.
